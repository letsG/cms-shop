description: 'If you’re looking for a thick, structured tee that’s also super soft and breathable—look no further! The men’s garment-dyed heavyweight t-shirt ticks all the boxes and is made of 100% ring-spun cotton. The regular t-shirt style will complement most looks and fit you to a tee. • 100% ring-spun cotton • Fabric weight: 6.1 oz/yd² (206.8 g/m²) • Garment-dyed • Relaxed fit • 7/8″ double-needle topstitched collar • Twill-taped neck and shoulders for extra durability • Double-needle armhole, sleeve, and bottom hems • Blank product sourced from Honduras This product is made especially for you as soon as you place an order, which is why it takes us a bit longer to deliver it to you. Making products on demand instead of in bulk helps reduce overproduction, so thank you for making thoughtful purchasing decisions!'
